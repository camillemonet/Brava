# README

Brava is a webapp which enables users to log their physical exercise through a variety of ways. Users are able to save commonly-followed routes for running and biking, as well as save completed activities to keep track of their progress. Activities can optionally be associated with a route depending on the type of exercise. Activities and routes can be updated or deleted if needed, and can be shown in the users' feed or routes index page respectively.

React and Redux were used to configure the front-end and create presentational components, while Rails was used to create and order the database. To render the map for the creation and updating of routes, elements of the 'google-maps-react' package were used. Routes were drawn on the maps using the Directions API of Google Maps for Javascript.
